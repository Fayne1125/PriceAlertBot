All the libraries are already compiled into this single .exe file( NFTPriceAlert.exe). 
To run the system simply double click the .exe file and u should able to run without libraries issue.
Other file as config.json and sources do need to interact. 

To access the code of the this program, you can open the NFTPriceAlert.py file in any IDE which supports Python. 
However, you will need to import the libraries into your Python/IDE path for your system to run the application in Python.

Usually, running .exe file would be fine as everything its inside already.

Once in the App, it is advised to check out support tab to understand how to setup the application.

Thank You.
