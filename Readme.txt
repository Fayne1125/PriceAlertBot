# NFT Price Alert Bot

A Python-based automation tool that monitors NFT floor prices and sends alerts when prices reach specified thresholds.  
This project was developed as part of my Final Year Project (FYP).

> **Note:**  
> The main focus of this repository is to showcase my **code and development process**.  
> While there is an `.exe` version of the app, it has been excluded to comply with GitHub's file size limits and to keep the repository focused on source code.
